# yFiles CSS styling elements

![](./Screenshot.png)

This is a collection of custom styles for arrows, nodes and edges allowing for CSS styling. Note that it does not mean you can use all of the CSS magic. For instance, drop-shadow does not work on SVG elements like Rect. On the other hand, CSS animation is something which would be difficult via code or SVG constructs.
